The ".ots" and ".provenance.json" records are from OpenTimeStamps.org
from running Bitcoin_Anchor.py.

*Bitcoin_Anchor.py*
Anchors your file to the Bitcoin Blockchain.
Give it time after running for Bitcoin miners to process the Blockchain (10-24 hours).

*Bitcoin_Verify.py*
Verifies your file against the Bitcoin Blockchain. Requires .ots and .provenance.json files for that file
made with the Bitcoin_Anchor.py

Use Bitcoin_Verify.py to verify everything you download from https://furry-os.org to prevent
"Solarwinds" type attacks (where a hacker replaces a file with a hacked version and changes the website info).
